**NOTE: This program is mainly for Mac OS, but it's also optimized for Windows.**

## Description
This is a virtual assistant program that includes NLP (natural language processing) capabilities. You can open any app you want, and you can add your own apps very easily. To add an app, just say or type "add app". To remove an app, say or type "remove app".

## Disclaimer
This program was created as a school project for CBSE CS Grade 12. While I strive to make it the best it can be, please note that it may not be optimized for all use cases.
