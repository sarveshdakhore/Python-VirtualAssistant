python program made special for Mac OS there are lots of apps to open for Mac OS with just simple conversation as we do normally and even create, rename,open,view,delete files. may be some function will not work in windows, but this program is also optimised for Windows ,  because I don't have windows and I didn't tested in windows. but aps will open in windows.
